## Migration Plugin

This directory contains the code so version 0.6.0 of the GeoParquet Downloader plugin can be migrated to version 0.7.0 (and above). Releases should include both this directory and the main plugin directory.

After 3-6 months (so sometime June - September 2025), we should be able to remove this directory, as (hopefully) all users will have migrated to the new plugin.
